# `.threadlight/auto-state.json` — schema

`.threadlight/auto-state.json` is owned by the `threadlight-auto` guidance
contract. The Python planner in `references/orchestrator.py` reads this file to
decide what can resume; it does **not** write or migrate
`.threadlight/auto-state.json`. When invoked with `--commit`, `orchestrator.py`
writes `.threadlight/auto-next.json` for the coding agent to consume. Format:
pretty-printed JSON written by the guidance/agent side.

The root and any present known stage entries must be JSON objects. Missing
state remains a supported first/manual run; unreadable, invalid-JSON, or
non-object state instead warns and forces re-runs. Malformed known stage
entries force the affected stage and downstream stages to re-run. Unknown
keys remain untouched, and the planner never repairs or overwrites this file.

> **Schema.** Stage names are `preflight / design / deploy / safe_check /
> cost_projection / invoke`; primary artifact paths are `specs/SPEC.md`,
> `tests/postdeploy-manifest.json`, `specs/cost-manifest.json`,
> `docs/invoke-results.md`. `docs/safe-check-post.md` remains optional
> human-readable evidence for `safe_check`.

```

### Per-stage `artifact_hash` semantics

Design may omit `artifact_hash` for an existing manually written SPEC; that
retains the manual-write skip unless clarification markers are present.
A recorded Design hash must be a 64-character hexadecimal SHA-256 string:
`null`, empty strings, and other unusable values force a re-run, not a manual
skip. Preflight's separate marker still permits `foundation_sha256: null`
while Foundation is absent.

| Stage | Primary artifact hashed | Why |
|---|---|---|
| preflight | `.threadlight/preflight-passed.json` | Marker freshness |
| design | `specs/SPEC.md` | Drives all downstream gates (NEEDS CLARIFICATION scan, hash drift) |
| deploy | `infra/main.bicep` | Bicep authoring is the load-bearing artifact for safe-check |
| safe_check | `tests/postdeploy-manifest.json` | Semantic safe-check proof for resumption-aware invoke (`phase=post-deploy`, `gaps=[]`, fresh RFC3339 `checked_at`). `docs/safe-check-post.md` is optional human-readable evidence only. |
| cost_projection | `specs/cost-manifest.json` | Feeds `orchestrator.py`'s `_check_cost_projection` freshness/resumability check (trusted only when `schema_version` starts with `1.` and `generated_at` is newer than last deploy) |
| invoke | `docs/invoke-results.md` | Demo-scenario evidence; freshness gates re-run after spec change |
| evals | `specs/evals-manifest.json` | Discover leg — offline + online (Foundry CE) + A/B eval evidence consumed by production-ready pillar 6 |
| redteam | `specs/redteam-manifest.json` | Discover leg — AI Red Teaming Agent scan evidence consumed by production-ready pillar 7 (SAFE-1xx) |
| govern | `specs/govern-manifest.json` | Protect leg — AGT runtime-governance artefact consumed by production-ready pillar 2 + pillar 7 (RAI-002/003) |

### Cost-projection fields

`orchestrator.py::_check_cost_projection` uses the stage's `last_deploy_at` (fallback: `azd env`'s `AZURE_LAST_DEPLOY_AT`) together with `specs/cost-manifest.json.generated_at` to decide whether the existing forecast can be reused instead of re-running `scripts/consumption_iq.py run --all`. The planner trusts the manifest's `generated_at` vs the deploy marker for this decision. The `cost_projection.passed_at` entry is recorded by guidance for auditing/echoing only and is not consulted by `_check_cost_projection` to decide skip/run.

The environment fallback applies when `last_deploy_at` is absent. A present
but unusable value (including `null` or an empty string) forces a re-run rather
than silently falling back to a different deploy marker.

Preflight and Invoke use filesystem mtime; Evals, Red-team, and Govern use
`captured_at`. These automatic evidence windows require `0 <= age < 24 h`.
Future timestamps and the exact 24-hour boundary are not fresh. Invoke
additionally requires a regular `docs/invoke-results.md` file. Cost's distinct
`generated_at > last_deploy_at` comparison and manual-envelope contracts are
unchanged.

The stage entry may also carry a `cost-reconciliation` status
(`pass` / `degraded-source` / `not-verified`) when the optional actuals
subphase has run. That key is written by agent guidance, not read by
`_check_cost_projection` or any other orchestrator code path, so it is
intentionally left out of a fixed shape here — see `SKILL.md` § "Cost-projection
stage — optional reconciled-actuals subphase" for its informal contract.

## `recovery_events` shape

Every auto-recovery action `threadlight-auto` fires is appended to this list.

```json
{
  "recovery_events": [
    {
      "stage": "deploy",
      "fired_at": "2026-06-01T16:08:42Z",
      "signature": "InsufficientQuota for 'gpt-5.4-mini' in swedencentral (F-03)",
      "action": "switched AZURE_LOCATION → westus3",
      "rationale": "az cognitiveservices usage list --location westus3 reported 0/1000 headroom",
      "retry_succeeded": true
    }
  ]
}
```

Recovery events are also rendered into `docs/auto-run.md` (operator-facing
markdown log) so the operator can review what auto-magic happened during
their run without parsing JSON.

## Migrations

There are no planner-side migrations. If guidance bumps `version`, the
guidance/agent that owns `.threadlight/auto-state.json` must write the new
shape before the planner reads it. `orchestrator.py` treats the file as
read-only state input.

## What this file is NOT

- Not a backup of every tool's stdout/stderr — that's in `docs/auto-run.md`
- Not a substitute for `azd env get-values` or `azd ai agent show` — both queried live during Deploy
- Not a security boundary — contains no secrets (only resource names + hashes)
